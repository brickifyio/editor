# Brick

It's a project prototype. It's a kind of editor (wysiwyg) where each component is a brick. Also the project is an example of functional patterns. I'm not good at them, but this project will be a good start to understand functional paradigms.

If you have any suggestions or you want to try yourself in it you can help me handle it.

I will provide you with every idea I have about the approaches and maybe we can develop a game changer in the field.

## Useful links

- [Reactjs](https://react.dev/). The core library for this is reactjs.
- [Airbnb codestyle](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). I really like it and I hope you're familiar with this approach.
- [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/). I decided to use fp-ts since it's good enough in typescript and easy to use.

## Development

It's a [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) project, so you can easily run the following commands to run the application:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```
